## GT Buzz Mobile Health

Buzz Mobile Health is an organization of students at Georgia Tech that aims to reduce health disparities among the underserved population in Atlanta. Through partnership with [Antioch Baptist Church] (http://antiochurban.org/) and [Give Homeless Hope] (http://givehomelesshope.org/), we hope to provide both preventative and diagnostic care to financially disadvantaged individuals in the Atlanta, GA area. We are undergraduate students who work with medical students, PA students, medical providers, and bioinformatics researchers to provide a holistic approach to street medicine.
